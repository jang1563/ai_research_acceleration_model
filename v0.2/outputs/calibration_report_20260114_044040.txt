6. IMPLICATIONS FOR AI PROJECTIONS
----------------------------------------

  Based on historical calibration, the model suggests:

  - Capability extensions can achieve 100x acceleration
  - Methodological shifts achieve 20x acceleration
  - Democratization provides 2.3x additional boost
  - Infrastructure investment provides 1.5x boost

  AI as capability extension (like HGP, AlphaFold) could achieve:
    - 153x with infrastructure investment
    - 229x with democratization
