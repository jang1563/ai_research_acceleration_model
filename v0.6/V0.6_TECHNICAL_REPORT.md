# AI Research Acceleration Model v0.6

## Triage & Selection Model: Addressing the Backlog Problem

**Version**: 0.6
**Date**: January 2026
**Status**: Complete

---

## Executive Summary

v0.6 introduces the **Triage & Selection Model**, addressing a critical limitation in previous versions: when AI generates hypotheses faster than labs can validate them, a backlog accumulates that limits effective acceleration.

**Key Finding**: The GNoME case study showed 365× stage acceleration but only 1× end-to-end acceleration due to a 6,286-year validation backlog. v0.6 explicitly models this constraint.

## Model Evolution

| Version | Focus | Key Addition |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| v0.1-v0.3 | Cognitive | Stage-by-stage acceleration, 6 case studies |
| v0.4 | Refined | Domain profiles, shift types, 9 case studies |
| v0.5 | Physical | Lab automation, integrated model |
| **v0.6** | **Selection** | **Triage efficiency, backlog dynamics** |

---

## The Selection Problem

### Why Triage Matters

v0.5 assumed validation capacity grows smoothly with automation. Reality is different:

1. **Generation Rate (G)**: AI can generate 100,000-1,000,000 hypotheses/year
2. **Validation Capacity (V)**: Labs validate 100-10,000 experiments/year
3. **When G >> V**: Backlog accumulates exponentially

### The GNoME Problem

```
Generated:     2,200,000 stable materials
Validated:     350/year (global synthesis rate)
Backlog Years: 6,286 years
Stage Accel:   365×
E2E Accel:     1.0× (unchanged)
```

**Insight**: Without intelligent selection, massive AI acceleration creates backlogs that eliminate practical speedup.

## v0.6 Model Components

### 1. Triage Model (`triage_model.py`)

Models hypothesis-to-validation pipeline:

```python
# Key parameters
generation_rate: float      # Hypotheses/year from AI
validation_capacity: float  # Experiments/year in labs
triage_efficiency: float    # Success rate after selection
```

**Triage Strategies**:
- FIFO (no intelligence)
- Confidence-ranked (AI confidence scores)
- Expected value (maximize scientific value)
- Active learning (optimize model improvement)

### 2. Backlog Dynamics (`backlog_dynamics.py`)

Tracks backlog accumulation over time:

```python
# Risk levels
LOW:      < 1 year backlog
MODERATE: 1-10 years
HIGH:     10-100 years
CRITICAL: > 100 years
```

**Benchmarks**:
| Case Study | Domain | Backlog Years |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| GNoME | Materials | 6,286 |
| AlphaMissense | Genomics | 7,100 |
| ESM-3 | Protein Design | 2,000 |
| Drug Discovery | Drug | 10 |

### 3. Integrated v0.6 Model (`integrated_v06_model.py`)

Combines all constraints:

```python
Effective_Acceleration = min(
    v0.5_Acceleration,           # Physical + cognitive
    Triage_Limited_Acceleration  # Selection capacity
)
```

## Key Results

### Model Comparison (2030 Projections)

| Domain | v0.5 | v0.6 | Triage Impact |
|--------|------|------|---------------|
| Structural Biology | 22.0× | 11.0× | -50% |
| Materials Science | 3.6× | 3.6× | 0% |
| Protein Design | 3.7× | 3.7× | 0% |
| Drug Discovery | 3.9× | 3.9× | 0% |
| Clinical Genomics | 3.9× | 3.9× | 0% |

**Key Insight**: Structural biology sees the largest triage impact because:
- High validation capacity (cryo-EM, X-ray automated)
- AlphaFold creates massive backlog of structures to validate

### Validation Results

Validated against 9 case studies:
- **Mean log error**: 0.23 (unchanged from v0.5 for historical data)
- **Validation score**: 0.77
- **Backlog detection**: 8/9 cases correctly identified as critical risk

## Domain Triage Profiles

### Materials Science
```
Generation:    100,000 → 100M/year
Validation:    500 → 50,000/year
Success Rate:  1% (random) → 20% (AI triage)
Bypass:        30% via simulation
```

### Drug Discovery
```
Generation:    10,000 → 10M/year
Validation:    1,000 → 100,000/year (HTS)
Success Rate:  0.1% (random) → 5% (AI triage)
Bypass:        20% via ADMET prediction
```

### Protein Design
```
Generation:    1M → 1B/year
Validation:    500 → 10,000/year
Success Rate:  0.1% (random) → 10% (AI triage)
Bypass:        40% via AlphaFold validation
```

## Backlog Dynamics Over Time

### Materials Science Projection (2024-2050)

| Year | Generation | Validation | Backlog | Years to Clear |
|------|------------|------------|---------|----------------|
| 2024 | 100,000 | 500 | 99,500 | 199 |
| 2030 | 2,008,554 | 1,054 | 2,271,303 | ∞ |
| 2040 | 57,665,039 | 2,594 | 64,792,946 | ∞ |
| 2050 | 1,655,378,866 | 6,389 | 1,862,432,477 | ∞ |

**Conclusion**: Without intervention, backlog grows unsustainably in most domains.

## Solution Pathways

### 1. Lab Automation (v0.5)
- **Impact**: 10-50× validation capacity
- **Limitation**: Still can't match AI generation rates

### 2. AI Triage (v0.6)
- **Impact**: 10-100× better selection (higher success rate)
- **Approach**: Confidence ranking, expected value optimization
- **Limitation**: Still validates same number, just better ones

### 3. Simulation Bypass (Future)
- **Impact**: Skip physical validation entirely
- **Potential**: 30-80% of hypotheses (domain-dependent)
- **Requirement**: Simulation accuracy must match physical validation

## Key Conclusions

1. **Selection is the hidden bottleneck**: AI acceleration without triage creates unsustainable backlogs

2. **Stage acceleration ≠ End-to-end acceleration**: GNoME showed 365× stage but 1× end-to-end

3. **Triage is the force multiplier**: Intelligent selection can provide 10-100× improvement in success rate

4. **Domain-specific impact**: High-throughput domains (structural biology) see larger triage effects

5. **Future work needed**: v0.7 should model simulation bypass as a third pathway to address backlogs

---

## Next Steps for v0.7

1. **Simulation Bypass Model**: When can AI simulation replace physical validation?
2. **Multi-path Optimization**: Allocate resources across validation, triage, and simulation
3. **Dynamic Triage**: Model improving triage efficiency over time
4. **Cross-domain Learning**: How insights from one domain transfer to others
