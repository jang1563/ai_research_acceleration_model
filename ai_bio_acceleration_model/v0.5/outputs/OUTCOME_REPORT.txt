AI-ACCELERATED BIOLOGICAL DISCOVERY: OUTCOME TRANSLATION REPORT
======================================================================

This report translates model outputs into concrete, policy-relevant
outcomes that non-specialists can understand.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT THIS MEANS (Pessimistic Scenario)
==================================================

PACE OF DISCOVERY: 2.4x current speed
By 2050, biological research will move significantly faster than today.

THERAPY IMPACT: ~82 new therapies
Compared to ~50 at current pace,
this represents +32 additional breakthrough treatments.

IN HUMAN TERMS:
Each additional therapy typically benefits 500,000 - 2 million patients
over its lifecycle. This acceleration could impact tens of millions of lives.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT THIS MEANS (Baseline Scenario)
==================================================

PACE OF DISCOVERY: 3.6x current speed
By 2050, biological research will move dramatically faster than today.

THERAPY IMPACT: ~125 new therapies
Compared to ~50 at current pace,
this represents +75 additional breakthrough treatments.

IN HUMAN TERMS:
Each additional therapy typically benefits 500,000 - 2 million patients
over its lifecycle. This acceleration could impact tens of millions of lives.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT THIS MEANS (Optimistic Scenario)
==================================================

PACE OF DISCOVERY: 4.6x current speed
By 2050, biological research will move transformatively faster than today.

THERAPY IMPACT: ~160 new therapies
Compared to ~50 at current pace,
this represents +110 additional breakthrough treatments.

IN HUMAN TERMS:
Each additional therapy typically benefits 500,000 - 2 million patients
over its lifecycle. This acceleration could impact tens of millions of lives.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

THERAPEUTIC AREA COMPARISON
==================================================

RANKING BY 2050 PROGRESS:
  1. Oncology         128.5 yr (4.9x)
  2. Rare Disease      95.9 yr (3.7x)
  3. General           93.5 yr (3.6x)
  4. Cns               76.0 yr (2.9x)

KEY INSIGHT:
  Oncology will see 69% more progress than Cns
  (128 vs 76 equivalent years)

WHY THE GAP:
  - Oncology: Benefits from biomarker-driven trial designs
  - Cns: Complex biology, lower trial success rates

POLICY IMPLICATION:
  Extra investment in Cns infrastructure may be warranted
  to close the gap with Oncology.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

POLICY IMPLICATIONS
==================================================

KEY FINDING: AI could accelerate biological discovery by 3.6x,
potentially delivering +75 additional therapies by 2050.

BOTTOM LINE: Even accounting for physical constraints (clinical trials,
regulatory processes), AI-driven acceleration is substantial and real.

CRITICAL BOTTLENECK: Phase II clinical trials remain the limiting factor.
Policy interventions targeting trial efficiency have highest ROI.

PATIENT IMPACT: Estimated 75 million additional patients
could benefit from accelerated therapeutic development.
