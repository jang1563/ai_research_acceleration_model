# AI Research Acceleration Model v0.9

## Technical Report: System-Level Analysis

**Version**: 0.9
**Date**: January 2026
**Previous Version**: v0.8

---

## Executive Summary

v0.9 extends the AI Research Acceleration Model to capture **system-level dynamics**:

1. **Cross-Domain Interaction Effects**: How acceleration in one domain enables acceleration in others
2. **Workforce Impact Modeling**: Jobs displaced, created, and net employment effects
3. **Policy Recommendation Engine**: Actionable recommendations for stakeholders
4. **Integrated System Analysis**: Comprehensive view of the AI-biology landscape

**Key Result**: Cross-domain spillover effects amplify acceleration by 10-30%, but clinical trials remain the dominant bottleneck for drug discovery regardless of advances in related domains.

---

## 1. Cross-Domain Interaction Effects

### 1.1 Conceptual Framework

Scientific domains don't accelerate in isolation. v0.9 models how advances in one domain create spillover effects that enable acceleration in others.

**Example**: AlphaFold (structural biology) enables:
- Structure-based drug design → Drug Discovery (+40% direct effect)
- Protein engineering targets → Protein Design (+50% direct effect)
- Variant interpretation → Clinical Genomics (+25% direct effect)

### 1.2 Interaction Matrix

| Source → Target | Drug Discovery | Materials | Protein Design | Clinical Genomics |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Structural Biology | +40% | +15% | +50% | +25% |
| Drug Discovery | - | +10% | +20% | +15% |
| Materials Science | +8% | - | +10% | +5% |
| Protein Design | +30% | +12% | - | +20% |
| Clinical Genomics | +20% | +5% | +15% | - |

### 1.3 Lag Effects

Cross-domain effects are not immediate:
- Structural → Drug Discovery: 1.0 year lag
- Drug Discovery → Clinical: 2.0 year lag
- Materials → Protein Design: 1.5 year lag

### 1.4 Results (2030)

| Domain | Standalone | Cross-Domain Boost | Total |
|--------|------------|-------------------|-------|
| Structural Biology | 4.5x | +12% | 5.0x |
| Drug Discovery | 1.4x | +28% | 1.8x |
| Materials Science | 1.0x | +15% | 1.2x |
| Protein Design | 2.5x | +35% | 3.4x |
| Clinical Genomics | 2.0x | +22% | 2.4x |

## 2. Workforce Impact Modeling

### 2.1 Job Categories Analyzed

Each domain includes multiple job categories:
- Research Scientists
- Lab Technicians
- Data Analysts
- Computational Specialists
- Clinical Staff
- Regulatory Affairs

### 2.2 Displacement vs. Creation

AI/automation affects jobs through:
1. **Task automation**: AI replaces specific tasks (higher for cognitive work)
2. **Physical automation**: Robots replace lab work (higher for technicians)
3. **Job transformation**: Roles shift to higher-value activities
4. **Job creation**: New roles emerge (AI trainers, curators, interpreters)

### 2.3 Results by Domain (2030)

| Domain | Current (M) | Displaced (M) | Created (M) | Net (M) | Severity |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-------------|---------|----------|
| Structural Biology | 0.15 | 0.04 | 0.06 | +0.02 | Low |
| Drug Discovery | 1.10 | 0.22 | 0.35 | +0.13 | Low |
| Materials Science | 0.50 | 0.12 | 0.18 | +0.06 | Medium |
| Protein Design | 0.18 | 0.04 | 0.09 | +0.05 | Low |
| Clinical Genomics | 0.08 | 0.02 | 0.04 | +0.02 | Low |
| **TOTAL** | **2.01** | **0.44** | **0.72** | **+0.28** | - |

### 2.4 Key Insight

**Net job impact is positive (+280,000 jobs globally) but distribution is uneven**:
- High-skill AI-augmented roles grow significantly
- Routine lab technician roles decline
- Transition support essential to avoid harm
