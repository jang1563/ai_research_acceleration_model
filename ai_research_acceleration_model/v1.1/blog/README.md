# AI Research Acceleration Model v1.1 - Blog Series

## Published Posts

### Post 1: The 2.8x Ceiling (Expert Audience)
**File**: `post1_pipeline_problem.md`
**Target Audience**: Scientists, policymakers, investors, industry professionals
**Reading Time**: ~18 minutes
**Expert Score**: 8.0/10

**Summary**: A quantitative framework explaining why AI accelerates biological research by 2.8x (not 10x or 100x). Introduces the "pipeline discount" concept and the Bits/Hybrid/Atoms framework. Includes policy recommendations, risk scenarios, and audience-segmented calls to action.

**Key Concepts**:
- Pipeline Discount Factor
- Bits-Only / Hybrid / Atoms-Bound task taxonomy
- Spillover Network effects
- Bear case scenarios with probability weightings

### Post 2: Why Can't AI Just Cure Everything Already? (Student Audience)
**File**: `post2_explainer_students.md`
**Target Audience**: High school students (ages 15-18)
**Reading Time**: ~15 minutes
**Expert Score**: 7.3/10

**Summary**: An accessible explainer using everyday analogies (pizza delivery, video games, traffic jams) to help students understand why AI's computational speedups don't translate directly to faster cures. Includes interactive quiz questions and career guidance.

**Key Analogies**:
- 🍕 Pizza Delivery (100x faster ordering ≠ faster pizza)
- 🎮 Video Game Loading Screens (can't skip the cutscenes)
- 🚗 Traffic Jams (10x faster highway, still stuck in city)
- 🏭 Factory Assembly (50x faster design, same manufacturing time)

## Key Tweetable Quotes

**From Post 1:**
> "The bottleneck isn't AI capability—it's atoms, not bits."

> "Regulatory innovation may ultimately matter more than AI innovation for drug development timelines."

> "For every year we shave off therapeutic development, there are children like Emily who receive treatment instead of funerals."

**From Post 2:**
> "AI discovered 2.2 million new materials in one day. Making them all? 2,200 years."

> "The pizza still needs to bake. The driver still needs to drive. AI made ordering 100x faster. Your pizza arrives 2% sooner."
